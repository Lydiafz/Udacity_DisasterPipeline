## Project description
The current project is part of my Data Scientist Nanodegree of the Udacity. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to categorize different disaster events, so that the messages can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. The project will finally build a web app that a new message can be input and then get classification results in several categories. 

Overall, the project includes an ETL Pipeline, a Machine learning pipeline, and a web app.
